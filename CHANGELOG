0.3.1
 - Phalcon garbage collector incrementally releases memory allocated after the end of a particular execution trace reducing memory fragmentation.

0.3.0
 - Refactoring many code patterns as C macros, the total base code was reduced by about 8000 lines of code less.
 - Most function calls was rewriten to avoid any string length counting by avoiding potential use of strlen. Functions and methods names have fixed string lengths improving general performance. This improvement was also implemented for static string concatenation.
 - We have implemented some kind of Register Allocation to take advantage of processor registers. However, compiler will choose best register allocations when it compiles the extension.
 - Support for PHP 5.4. A number of issues when running Phalcon under PHP 5.4 were identified and corrected.
 - In some cases memory was copied without need when updating internal arrays, them were fixed.
 - A function cache was included to avoid potential function lookups on internal HashTables. This cache stores internal pointers to functions low level code improving performance.

0.2.6
 - Fixing segfault when reading _SESSION superglobal when no session_start has been made
 - Added Phalcon_Cache with adapter File
 - Added method Phalcon_Model_Manager::getHasOneRecords
