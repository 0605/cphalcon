0.4.0
- Fixed possible segmentation fault when releasing memory of zval strings that has constant values

- Moved zval separation to phalcon_array_update_*
- Moved zval separation to phalcon_array_append_*
- Moved zval constructor to phalcon_array_update_*
- Implemented functions to avoid using an array of zvals parameters for static and method calls
- Removed error reporting silence from the extension
- Removed thousands of unnecessary referencing/deferencing vars when calling functions/methods

0.3.5
 - Most of throw exception process has been rewrriten to use less instructions
 - Super global initialization is now slightly fast
 - Fixed bug in Phalcon_Db::close
 - Added logging capabilities to Phalcon_Db
 - Added Phalcon_Model_Metadata::getIdentityField allowing to know the identity (auto_increment) field
 - Added DDL and DML methods to Phalcon_Db
 - Added Phalcon_Db_Column to describe table columns
 - Added Phalcon_Db_Index to describe table indexes
 - Added Phalcon_Db_Reference to describe table references (foreign keys)

0.3.4
 - Fixed wrong implementation in Phalcon_Tag::javascriptInclude
 - Added Phalcon_Cache_Frontend_Output
 - Renamed Phalcon_Db_Mysql to Phalcon_Db_Adapter_Mysql
 - Renamed Phalcon_Cache_Adapter_File to Phalcon_Cache_Frontend_File
 - Added Phalcon_Request::setRawHeader
 - Added Phalcon_Paginator_Adapter_Array
 - Fixed bugs in model paginator
 - Added Phalcon_Tag::hiddenField
 - Added Phalcon_Tag::fileField
 - Added Phalcon_Loader to autoload classes based on some conventions
 - Added Phalcon_Db_Profiler to profile database operations and determine posible bottlenecks
 - Added methods to query table metadata: Phalcon_Db::describeTable, Phalcon_Db::describeIndexes and Phalcon_Db::describeReferences
 - Fixed segmentation fault in Phalcon_Db::tableExists
 - Fixed memory leak in Phalcon_Paginator
 - Adding Zend Thread Safety (ZTS) support to Phalcon Memory Manager

0.3.3
 - Added Phalcon_Tag::setDefault as an alias for Phalcon_Tag::displayTo
 - Added Phalcon_View::setVar as an alias for Phalcon_View::setParamToView
 - Added ACL managment with in-memory lists
 - Fixed segfaults on methods with array optional parameters
 - Fixed segfaults on some isset
 - Added built-in model attributes validators
 - Added Phalcon_ACL to manage access lists
 - Added missing Phalcon_Tag::passwordField

0.3.2
 - Fixed separation of super globals by mistake causing segmentation faults
 - Support for compilation on Visual C++ 6.0
 - Fixed segmentation faults when required parameters are not given for most methods

0.3.1
 - Phalcon garbage collector incrementally releases memory allocated after the end of a particular execution trace reducing memory fragmentation.

0.3.0
 - Refactored many code patterns as C macros, the total base code was reduced by about 8000 lines of code less.
 - Most function calls was rewriten to avoid any string length counting by avoiding potential use of strlen. Functions and methods names have fixed string lengths improving general performance. This improvement was also implemented for static string concatenation.
 - We have implemented some kind of Register Allocation to take advantage of processor registers. However, compiler will choose best register allocations when it compiles the extension.
 - Support for PHP 5.4. A number of issues when running Phalcon under PHP 5.4 were identified and corrected.
 - In some cases memory was copied without need when updating internal arrays, them were fixed.
 - A function cache was included to avoid potential function lookups on internal HashTables. This cache stores internal pointers to functions low level code improving performance.

0.2.6
 - Fixed segfault when reading _SESSION superglobal when no session_start has been made
 - Added Phalcon_Cache with adapter File
 - Added method Phalcon_Model_Manager::getHasOneRecords
